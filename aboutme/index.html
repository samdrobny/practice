<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Samantha Drobny and I am aspiring to be a graphic designer. A little bit about me, I grew up in the suburbs of Dallas Texas but I am now living in a small town in Colorado. In my free time I enjoy hiking and trail running with my two dogs, snowboarding, rafting, embroidering, and drawing with charcoal. 

    I am down to earth and enjoy the simple things in life, I especially  enjoy nature and the outdoors and incorporate this passion into my design work. I like to keep things simple and elegant. I specialize in single page design and branding however, I have experience in  typography, web design, and user experience.
